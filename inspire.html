    <h2>Self Taught Guitarists</h2>
        <h3>Jimi Hendrix</h3>
        <p> Jimi Hendrix is highly regarded as one of the best (if not the best) guitarists of all time. 
            Something that surprised me about Hendrix was that he was not classically trained like many of his peers - 
            he was entirely self-taught. This helped give him his unmistakable style that is copied by many others today.
            As the story goes, Hendrix, while helping his father clean a garage for work, found a ukulele with one string. 
            Using this instrument, he matched the tune with the radio. Sometime later, at the age of 15, he purchased an acoustic 
            guitar for $5 and would match the styles of veteran guitarists. The rest was history. </p>
