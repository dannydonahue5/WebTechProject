      <img src="images/hendrix.PNG" style="height: 400px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" >
      <div class="info"><p>Jimi Hendrix is highly regarded as one of the best (if not the best) guitarists of all time. 
        Something that surprised me about Hendrix was that he was not classically trained like many of his peers - 
        he was entirely self-taught. This helped give him his unmistakable style that is copied by many others today. 
        As the story goes, Hendrix, while helping his father clean a garage for work, found a ukulele with one string. 
        Using this instrument, he matched the tune with the radio. It was only at the age of 15 when he purchased an 
        acoustic guitar for $5 and would match the styles of veteran guitarists.</p>

        <img src="images/clapton.PNG" style="height: 400px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" >
        <div class="info"><p>Eric Clapton learned guitar completely by ear - he would collect blues albums, 
            tape them with his reel-to-reel recorder and play back individual phrases repeatedly until he got them perfectly.
        He also has the nickname "slowhand" because he was slow at changing broken strings, causing the crowd to "slow hand clap" 
        him while he changed the string.</p>

        <div class="info"><p>Prince is an insanely talented self-taught musician. He is a master of guitar, bass, saxophone,
            and piano - as well as one of the greatest performers of all time. He has left a lasting legacy on the world of music.

        <img src="images/vanhalen.PNG" style="height: 400px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" >
        <div class="info"><p>Eddie Van Halen is another self-taught prodigy. The song "Eruption" was just him and his brother, Alex
            noodling around prepping for a gig until his producer insisted they recorded it. Van Halen radicalized the way the instrument
            was played, and redefined how it could be built and how it could sound. He pioneered the technique known as "finger tapping"
            which means playing the guitar with two hands, kind of like a piano. The approach was so revolutionary that Alex encouraged him
            to play gigs with his back to the audience so musicians wouldn't steal his ideas before he had a record deal.

        <img src="images/grohl.PNG" style="height: 400px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" >
        <div class="info"><p>Dave Grohl is the founder of the rock band Foo Fighters (he is also the singer, guitarist, and
            primary songwriter) and he was the drummer for Nirvana from 1990 to 1994. He began learning guitar at the age of
            12. As a teenager, he auditioned to be a drummer for a band Scream and lied about his age to be considered for the position. 
            They asked him to join, and he dropped out of high school his junior year. He describes how he only knows a few basic chords 
            on guitar, explained more in this <a style ="text-decoration: none;" href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixo-MQ0u6SA">video.</a>

        <img src="images/urban.PNG" style="height: 400px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" >
        <div class="info"><p>Keith Urban is an Australian country music singer, songwriter, and record producer. He started
            playing at the age of six, and as a teenager he played steady guitar gigs in pubs and clubs. He quit school at 15 to pursue
            musical interests - two years later he won an award at an Australian country music festival. It was 
            <a style ="text-decoration: none;" href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVbyWunzpzU"> this performance</a> with John 
            Mayer that got me inspired to play guitar.

        <div class="info"><p>Last but certaintly not least in any way is John Mayer. He is arguably my greatest inspiration. He 
            attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, and has an extensive and deep understanding of the instrument. He is inspiring
            a lot of modern day guitarists with his unique style. Check out him performing his song "Neon"
