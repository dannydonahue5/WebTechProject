    <h1>Project Proposal Questions:</h1>
    <ol type="I">
    <ul>
        <b><li>What is your website about?</li></b>
        <p>
My website is going to be dedicated to teaching yourself how to play guitar.
        </p>
        <b><li>What is the objective of your website?</li></b>
        <p>
The objective of my website is to show my users that you can teach yourself anything, at any 
age, with persistence and passion. When I was given a lot of free time during COVID, I spent it
teaching myself guitar. There are a lot of things I learned and advice I have now about how
I would teach myself if I were to do it over again.  
        </p>
        <b><li>Who is your target audience?</li></b>
        <p>
My target audience is anybody who wants to learn an instrument. I don't think this project has
an age focus, but I can market this best towards college-aged individuals using my networks. 
        </p>
        <b><li>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</li></b>
        <p>
I have a few ideas of things that I want to include. First I want to have an about me/my story
page on the website. Here, I will talk about how I learned guitar, my struggles, and include 
old videos of me vs. videos of me playing now. Next, I want to divide my website into a beginner 
section (with advice, information, and song recommendations with examples) and an intermediate
section (with the same content). I also want to include sections about choosing which guitars to 
purchase and reviews on each (something I want to do anyway), and maybe advice on how to record
(this is something I want to get more into but have to do more research about.) I have tons 
of videos of me playing already (I know 50+ songs and have 30+ well recorded videos), so I won't be
doing a ton of extra outside work on that front. I also want to include a sample practice schedule
and videos of scales/exercises to practice.
