    <p>This is my guitar progress from the last 2 1/2 years. I hope you enjoy!</p>
    <h2>Videos from 2020:</h2>
    <h4>Wonderful Tonight</h4>
    <video width="400" height = "300" controls>
        <source src ="videos/wonderfultonight2020.MP4" type = video/MP4>
    </video>
    <p>This video was taken about 3 months into learning. It was the first song that I learned how to play in full.
        This is a great song for beginners because it builds on all of the beginner chords you first learn. 
        As you can hear, my playing lacked the flow that makes the song great. However, at the time I recorded the 
        video I was very proud of how far I came in a short time.  
    </p>
    <h2>Videos from 2021:</h2>
    <h4>Here Comes the Sun</h4>
    <video width="400" height = "300" controls>
        <source src ="videos/March 2021.mp4" type = video/MP4>
    </video>
    <p>Now at about 8 months into learning, I can see noticeable improvement. In this song I am still building off of the 
        basic chords but I am adding in different techniques which I will build on in the upcoming videos. At this point in 
        my learning I was really happy about how I was beginning to sound, especially because I didn't feel like I was annoying
        people by practicing. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I surprisingly do not have many videos from 2021 - I went through a phase of not recording because I felt that it was taking 
        away from the joy I got from playing. I only had limited time to play because I was back in swim season. However, I got COVID
        January 2022 and when I was quarentined for 10 days I decided to create dannyd_guitar. In fact, the first videos on my Instagram
        are recorded in the bathroom of the quarentine dorms on campus. After creating the account, I realized the importance of recording 
        because it creates a cool log of progress - I try to dedicate about one day a week to recording new content. 
    </p>
    <h2>Videos from 2022</h2>
    <h4>Wonderful Tonight (again)</h4>
        <video width="400" height = "300" controls>
            <source src ="videos/WonderfulTonight2022.MP4" type = video/MP4>
        </video>
        <p>About one year and a half in, I recorded this harder version of a song I already learned "Wonderful Tonight." I use more
            intermediate/advanced techniques here. There is a great difference between my 2020 version and my 2022 version of the song - 
            this was a point that I realized I had come a long way. 
        </p>
