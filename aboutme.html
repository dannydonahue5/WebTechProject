        <h1>Personal & Professional</h1>
        <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>Hello! &#128512; My name is Danny Donahue. I am a senior at Babson College studying finance and data analytics.</p>
        <p>On campus, I am involved in a few organizations including GIVE and the Swim & Dive team. 
            I also like to go to the gym, and go on runs. In my free time, I spend time with family and friends, 
            read or listen to podcasts.</p>
        <p>Post-graduation, I will be working at Dell Technologies as a financial analyst apart of their two-year 
            rotational program</p>

        <h3>Inspiration for the Website</h3>
        <h4>MY STORY</h4>
        <p>Through the curriculum at Babson College, I was able to expand some of my skills and learn how to code using HTML and 
            Javascript. As a deliverable for the class, I was given the task to create a website about anything of my choosing. 
            I knew that I wanted to create a website about how to teach yourself how to play guitar - it is something I did about 
            2 Â½ years ago during COVID. The purpose of this website is to synthesize the information and materials I found useful 
            over the process of teaching myself how to play and I want to prove that you don't need a fancy guitar or private lessons
            to learn. In addition, this site will include my personal advice, challenges, 
            progress, and next steps. Enjoy &#127928;!
        </p>

        <p style = "text-align: justify;" >During my sophomore year of college, we were all sent home due to COVID-19 and I quickly found myself practicing a monotonous routine. 
            I think like everyone, I started to spend a lot of time watching YouTube videos. One day, I came across a video of John Mayer 
            and Keith Urban playing "Don't Let Me Down" and was amazed. I did some research into the possibility of teaching myself how 
            to play guitar out of curiosity. I have very limited background in music. To my surprise, I found out that many great guitarists taught themselves how to play (including Keith Urban).</p>
        <p style = "text-align: justify;">My family owned an old guitar that had been in my basement for years. I looked up how to tune it, and I was all ready to go. 
            The only problem was I had no idea where to start. The amount of information was quite overwhelming.
        </p>
        <p style = "text-align: justify;">I found an app called "Yousician" where I learned the basic chords and how to strum, as well as some basic guitar theory. After I got the chords down, I was hooked. 
            Soon I was learning full songs and taking requests - fast forward to today where I can learn practically anything I want with time and patience.</p>
